Lymphography Classification

The development of the project is oriented to predict, starting from the results deriving from a lymphographer exam, which class target corresponds to the values ​​purchased.
The possible objectives to which the results required by the aforementioned examination may belong are Normal findings, Metastasis, Malignant lymph and Fibrosis.
In this regard, a series of both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques have been declared. Furthermore, it was modeled by an ontology of domain that offers a formal and conceptualized representation of the reality examined, both related to other ontologies already present and can be questioned.
The dataset belongs to one of the three domains provided by the Institute of Oncology (breast cancer and primary cancer). It includes:
Target variable

lym.nodes dimin: 0-3
lym.nodes enlar: 1-4
changes in lym.: bean, oval, round
defect in node: no, lacunar, lac. marginal, lac. central
changes in node: no, lacunar, lac. margin, lac. central
changes in stru: no, grainy, drop-like, coarse, diluted, reticular, stripped, faint,
special forms: no, chalices, vesicles
dislocation of: no, yes
exclusion of no: no, yes
no. of nodes in: 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, >=70
